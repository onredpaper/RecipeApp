# RecipeApp
Cooking recipe app using Python, Flask, Docker, JavaScript.

The starting point for this project was based on a tutorial found here: https://youtu.be/dam0GPOAvVI and code provided here: https://github.com/techwithtim/Flask-Web-App-Tutorial

The requirements for this project was to create a cooking recipe application that provided the following:
  - list view of recipes
  - add/edit/delete recipes
  - login mechanism optional

This was my inital use of Docker, Flask and integrating MySQL into the application.
